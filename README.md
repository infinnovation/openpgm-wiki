This repository contains wiki pages for the OpenPGM project,
extracted from the
[Google Code Archive](https://code.google.com/archive/p/openpgm/wikis)

Copyright for the pages is unknown but assumed to be suficiently
permissive to allow these copies.
The variant of Markdown is not quite the same as that used on github,
so expect some wrinkles.
